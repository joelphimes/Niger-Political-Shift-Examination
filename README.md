# Introduction
Thanks for joining me! I am excited to present my project on Niger's Political Shift: Examining the Possible Factors Driving the 2023 Instability.\
\
This presentation will explore various aspects of the Niger World Bank dataset and address several analytical inquiries about the country's instability over the last 25 years.

# Background

On 26 July 2023, a coup occurred in Niger, in which Niger's presidential guard detained President Bazoum, and the presidential guard commander general proclaimed himself the leader of a new military junta.\
\
Residential guard forces closed the country's borders, suspended state institutions, and declared a curfew. This was the fifth military coup d'état since the country gained independence from France in 1960.\
\
According to various sources, political instability, weak governance/corruption, economic troubles, factionalism, dissatisfaction within the military or military spending, weak democratic institutions, history of coups, and extreme poverty are chief indicators that drive coups.

# Stakeholder Value

- “So what?”: Niger's significance to U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Africa lies in its cooperation, hosting U.S. drone bases, American Special Forces, and logistics experts engaged in operations against Boko Haram and ISIS affiliates.\

- Informed Decision-Making: Analyzing historical data on political stability, leadership, economic health, and reliance on foreign aid. Stakeholders can gain insights into the country's historical political landscape and how it may have contributed to the coup.\

- Conflict Resolution: The data analysis can help identify potential triggers or contributing factors to political instability in Niger.

# Describing the Data

Dataset: 
- Trimmed down for 25/26 year time frame (1478 Rows, 30 Columns).

Interesting Features:
- World Governance Indicators (Political Stability, Control of Corruption, Government Effectiveness).
- Economic Indicators (Inflation, Gross Domestic Product, Unemployment, Gross Capital Formation).
- Foreign Aid (DAC Flows & Net ODA)

Categorization of Features: 
- String / Object (Indicator / Code)
- Float (Either USD, Percent, Aggregate Indicator)

Missing Data: 
- Minimized a lot of the missing data through the trimming to a 25/26 years time frame in most cases. 
- This worked well in terms of exploring the leaders by years in power. 
- Missing data in columns was handled by an Analytical Goal, case by case basis.
