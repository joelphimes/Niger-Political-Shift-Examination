# Niger Political Shift Examination


Student: Joel P Himes

# Introduction
Thanks for joining me! I am excited to present my project on Niger's Political Shift: Examining the Possible Factors Driving the 2023 Instability.\
\
This presentation will explore various aspects of the Niger World Bank dataset and address several analytical inquiries about the country's instability over the last 25 years.

# Background

On 26 July 2023, a coup occurred in Niger, in which Niger's presidential guard detained President Bazoum, and the presidential guard commander general proclaimed himself the leader of a new military junta.\
\
Residential guard forces closed the country's borders, suspended state institutions, and declared a curfew. This was the fifth military coup d'Ã©tat since the country gained independence from France in 1960.\
\
According to various sources, political instability, weak governance/corruption, economic troubles, factionalism, dissatisfaction within the military or military spending, weak democratic institutions, history of coups, and extreme poverty are chief indicators that drive coups.
