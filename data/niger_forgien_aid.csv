To do this, SHIGA will strive to achieve three main objectives:  Objective 1: Civil society holds responsible government more actively and effectively, and creates demand for targeted reforms and better implementation by the government. FSVC will provide technical assistance to civil society organizations to build their capacity to advocate for reforms. The technical approach is modeled on the incubation paradigm widely used successfully in the private sector for start-ups.  Objective 2: Targeted government institutions are more accountable to citizens, and more efficient and transparent in their operations. Capacity building will rely less on formal training and more on learning-by-doing, led by policy experts.  Objective 3: Create and/or strengthen spaces for constructive engagement between citizens, civil society and the state to identify and implement targeted priority reforms.",72068519CA00004,2021,29370,29370

Monitoring and evaluation challenges are compounded by the low capacity of many local organizations to effectively design and implement the collection of field data. In some instances, poor quality work has undermined or limited the value of monitoring and evaluation plans. The broad and varied nature of activities covered by RPGO also presents potential opportunities for cross-country or cross-program/-sectoral learning that can be enhanced through improved evaluation. To address these issues, the Evaluation and Analytical Services project will facilitate improved analysis of the impact of regional peace-building and governance interventions through more rigorous measurement and systematic documentation of results. It will provide a management tool for cross-country, cross-sectoral and cross-program learning and for future designs while also serving to upgrade local capacity for evaluation services.

It targets specific regions in the focus countries for TSCTP, which include Niger, Chad and Burkina Faso. TSCTP efforts are informed by a series of joint assessments and ongoing planning with interagency partners.PDev II builds on lessons learned from the previous regional program and earlier pilot programs. The overall goal of the program is to increase resiliency to violent extremism in at-risk communities by empowering youth, increasing moderate voices, enhancing civil society capacity to address community issues, and strengthening local governance.Violent Islamist extremist groups in the region (including AQIM and Boko Haram) attempt to use both weak governance and extremist messaging to radicalize more moderate communities with the aim of increasing numbers as well as expanding their support base. Using improved governance and media, the program fosters an environment that makes it more difficult for terrorists to gain local sponsorship, sanctuary and support.
